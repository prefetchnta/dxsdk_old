1) Installation
===============
*** IMPORTANT *** If you are installing a Windows 95 GLINT driver for
the first time, you must carefully follow the instructions below.
Specifically you should physically remove any GLINT card from your
machine before installing Windows 95. You should also ensure that you
do not plug in your GLINT card until after you have installed the
Windows 95 GLINT drivers. This is due to a bug in the Windows95
configuration manager. 3Dlabs are working with Microsoft to resolve
this.

2.1 	If you have not yet installed Windows 95, then before doing
	so power down your machine and physically remove the
	GLINT card. Then install Windows 95 using your VGA boot card.

2.2 	If you installed Windows 95 with a GLINT card physically
	present in your system or you plugged in your GLINT card
	before you installed the drivers, you may need to remove
	some incorrect registry entries that the configuration
	manager may have created:
	Right click on the "My Computer" ICON, and select "Properties".
	Access the Device Manager.
	Expand "Other Devices" (if present).
	Select "PCI Display Adaptor" (if present).
	Click the "Remove" button.
	Follow the instructions and allow the machine to reboot.

2.3 	Install the new drivers as follows:
	Open the control panel, and start the "Add New Hardware" wizard.
	When prompted check the box to tell Windows 95 NOT to search 
	for the new hardware and click "Next".
	Select the "Display adaptor" class, and "Next".
	Click "Have Disk" and follow the instructions to start
	installing from the GLINT driver floppy.

2.4 	Upon completion the machine will offer to shutdown to enable
	you to install the new hardware. Accept the shutdown request,
	and when you have powered down, physically install the
	Montserrat board.

2.5 	On reboot Windows 95 will recognise the board, select the
	correct display driver, and will then offer to reboot. Do
	NOT allow it to do so, but instead:
	Select "Continue".
	Right click on the "My Computer" ICON, and select "Properties".
	Access the Device Manager.
	Expand "Display adapters".
	Select your existing VGA compatible display adapter.
	Uncheck the "Orignal Configuration (Current)" box.
	Allow the machine to reboot when prompted.

2.6 	Check the Device Manager to ensure the GLINT drivers are being
	used. The icon for the VGA card should contain a monitor which
	is crossed out where the GLINT driver’s icon should be just a
	monitor. If the GLINT icon is crossed out, then there were
	additional problems with the installation. This can happen if
	you plugged in the GLINT board before you installed the
	drivers. Check the properties for the GLINT board. If there
	is a resource conflict with the VGA driver, you may need to
	remove the VGA driver from the Device Manager and reboot.

2.7 	You should now have a working GLINT driver running at
	640x480 256 colors. Use the Display Control Panel to change
	to other resolutions.
