Overview
--------
Welcome to the Windows 95 Game SDK.   If you did a full installation, you
will find a number of directories:

DOCS    - documentation

FOXBEAR - fox & bear sample demo of DirectDraw.  Requires 2MB of VRAM.
IKLOWNS - Immortal Klowns: demo of DirectDraw, DirectSound and DirectPlay.

          and debug versions of the Game Subsystem Components

Our supported development platform for this release is an ATI Mach64 card
and a Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 card.   The July beta will have
the full set of drivers supported by Win95 available.  

Also, drivers will be provided on Compuserv on an as available basis.  Updated
Win95 drivers for Cirrus, S3, and Tseng will be forthcoming.

NOTE: AFTER BOOTING, WIN95 WILL TELL YOU THAT SBFM.DRV, SB16DRV, AND/OR 
CSPMAN.DLL HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY OLDER VERSIONS.   THIS IS INCORRECT, CLICK 
ON "IGNORE" WHEN WIN95 REBOOTS TO USE THE DRIVERS INSTALLED.
