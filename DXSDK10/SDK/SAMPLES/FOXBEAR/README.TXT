The Fox & The Bear Sample
-------------------------

You need to run FOXBEAR from the FOXBEAR directory for it to find all of
its files.

You can add this section to your WIN.INI file to make FoxBear run in 
double buffer instead of triple buffer mode:

[FoxBear]
doublebuffer=1

Commands for using Foxbear:

    F12      - quit
    NUMPAD 2 - crouch
    NUMPAD 3 - throw an apple
    NUMPAD 4 - move right (hold down to run faster)
    NUMPAD 5 - stop
    NUMPAD 6 - move left (hold down to run faster)
    NUMPAD 7 - jump
