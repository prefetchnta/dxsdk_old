============================
= Limitations for Beta 1 ===
============================
- the 3D sound APIs aren't supported
The following APIs are supported for this Beta:

DIRECTSOUNDBUFFER methods:
    GetCaps
    SetCurrentPosition

DIRECTSOUND methods:
    ChangePlayingSpeed
    EnumModes
    EnumSoundBuffers
    FreeAllBuffers
    GetCaps
    GetCPULimit
    GetExclusiveMode
    GetMode
    GetVersion
    GetSpeakerConfig
    SetCPULimit
    SetExclusiveMode
    SetMode
    SetSpeakerConfig

===================================
=== Known Issues/Bugs in Beta 1 ===
===================================
- the SB16 driver can sometimes lock up when DirectSound first starts playing
after a reboot.   If this happens, just shut your machine off, and restart
it to reset the state of the SB16 card.

- an active wave file playing prevents creation of DirectSound object.   
This typically manifests itself when you have some sound scheme that causes 
sounds to be played all the time.  If sounds are playing when you try to 
connect to DirectSound, DirectSoundCreate will fail.

- Only one application can be connected to DirectSound at one time.


==================================
=== To Program for DirectSound ===
==================================
   Your app must be a 32 bit application.

   Create a DSound object with
        DirectSoundCreate. Parameters can be NULL and 0 for now.
        This will return a direct sound object. (DS)
   Create a primary buffer
        Use the CreateSoundBuffer method of the DS object.
        Specify the flags for LOOPING and PRIMARY
        This will return a direct sound buffer object. DSB
   Start the primary buffer playing
        Use the Play method of the DSB object.
        First parameter is the byte position to start playing. Set this to 0.
        Second parameter is flags. (LOOPING flag)
   Create secondary buffers.
        Use the CreateSoundBuffer method of the DS object.
        This will return a direct sound buffer object. DSB
   Load the secondary buffers with data.
        Use the Lock method of the DSB to obtain a pointer to the data area.
        Use the Unlock method of the DSB to set the data to the device.
   Play the secondary buffers.
        Use the Play method of the DSB object.
        First parameter is the byte position to start playing.
        Second parameter is flags. (LOOPING flag)

   Stop all buffers.
        Use the Stop method of the DSB object.
   Release the secondary buffers
   Release the primary buffer.
   Release the DSound object.
