=============================================
= Network requirements for using DirectPlay =
=============================================

To use this implementation of DirectPlay, ensure that
the TCP/IP protocol is installed on your machine.
This can be checked in the Network section of Control
Panel: TCP/IP should be listed as an installed network
component under the Configuration property sheet.  If not,
select Add, select to add a protocol, select Microsoft
as the manufacturer and finally choose TCP/IP as the
protocol to add.


========================================================
= Notes for connecting using DirectPlay user interface =
========================================================

In this implementation of DirectPlay, one player invites a number
of other players who have selected to wait to be invited.

On the call to Open(), DirectPlay displays a dialog.  The player
may either check the check box to indicate that they want to be invited,
or enter a list of other machines to contact. (one player enters 
the list, all the rest of the players will check that they want to be
invited)

To add to the list of other machines to contact, type either the machine name or the
IP address of the machine into the edit box, and hit Add.  If a 
name resolution services are available, the machine name will
be accepted, otherwise enter the IP address of the machine and hit Add.

When the inviting player hits OK, the inviting machine attempts
to contact the other machines for a period of time.  As other players
are contacted, they join the game world.

============================
= Limitations for Beta 1 ===
============================

Currently the following functions are unsupported:

EnumPlayers
GetCaps
Reply

EnumPreviousSessions : returns DPERR_NOSESSIONS

The DPOPEN_OPENSPECIFICSESSION flag is unsupported.

Send and Receive do not currently support guaranteed delivery
messages, all messages are sent TRYONCEFIRST and at equal priority.

Receive does not support DPRECEIVE_TOPLAYER.

DPSYSMSG_GAMEINFO is unsupported.

QueryInterface will always return a pointer to the IDirectPlay
interface.

DirectPlay does not support use from multiple threads.

DirectPlay does not currently support multi-homed TCP/IP
hosts, i.e. machines with more than one IP address, which
typically results from having more than one interface card
that TCP/IP is bound to.  This may result when a "dial-up
networking adapter" is installed as well as a normal network
card.  If this is the case, disable one of the TCP/IP
bindings by entering the Network section of Control Panel,
and selecting the card for which the binding is to be
disabled (e.g. the dial-up adapter).  Choose Properties,
and select the Bindings property sheet.  Uncheck the check box
which specifies the TCP/IP binding.


Note :
------
The current encoding of system messages and non-system messages
via the first byte of the message is liable to change in a later
release.  Code should be written to localize this distinction.
