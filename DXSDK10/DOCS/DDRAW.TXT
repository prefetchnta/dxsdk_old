============================
= Limitations for Beta 1 ===
============================

Some limitations exist for the first beta.   Some of the API's will return
the error DDERR_UNSUPPORTED, others have reduced functionality.

Palettes
--------
If the application has not done a SetExclusiveModeOwner, SetPaletteEntries 
will not work on the first 10/last 10 palette entries due to issues with the 
M8 build of Win95. Everything works fine if SetExclusiveModeOwner
is used (this also gives you faster access to the palettes, and is the 
preferred way for full screen games to operate).

Attachments
-----------
Manipulation of complex surfaces via the attachment APIs is unsupported in 
Beta 1.

    AddAttachedSurface
    DeleteAttachedSurfaces

Overlays 
--------
Unsupported in Beta 1.

    UpdateOverlay
    GetOverlayPosition
    GetOverlayZOrder
    SetOverlayPosition
    InsertOverlayZOrder
    SetOverlayZOrder

Composition Order
-----------------
Unsupported in Beta 1.

    AddSurfaceDependency
    Compose
    DeleteSurfaceDependency
    DestLock
    DestUnlock
    EnumSurfaceDependencies

    SetSurfaceDependency

Misc
----
EnumSurfaces will only enumerate existing surfaces in beta 1, it 
will not enumerate what surfaces can be created.
    
ClipLists, primarily for overlays, aren't supported in beta 1.

GetDC/ReleaseDC are unsupported in Beta 1
