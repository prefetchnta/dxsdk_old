The DirectX 2 documentation in this directory contains the same information as the WinHelp documentation in the Help directory of this SDK. The WinHelp format of the documentation is generally easier to use than the Word format because of its many hypertext links and other navigational aids. 

Before printing any of the Word documentation, you should rebuild the table of contents for that file so that the page numbers are accurate for your printer. To do this, select the table of contents in Word, click the selection by using the right mouse button, and then click Update Field.

The Word format of the Direct3D documentation is provided in three separate files so that the file sizes are more manageable. (The Direct3D documentation appears as one section in the WinHelp format.) The Direct3D documentation is divided into these sections: a Direct3D overview, a reference section for Direct3D Retained Mode, and a reference section for Direct3D Immediate Mode.
